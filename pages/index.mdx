# ðŸŒŒ What is this?

**create-universal-app (CUA)** is an opinionated template for creating full-stack universal (mobile + web codeshare) apps with built-in auth for both mobile and web using **Expo** (mobile), **NextJS** (web), **tRPC**, **Prisma**, **Tamagui** (UI + styling), and **Clerk** (mobile + web auth). A **demo** is live at [cua-demo.vercel.app](https://cua-demo.vercel.app/).

[Here's](https://youtu.be/aTEv0-ZBbWk) a 20 minute Youtube tutorial going over everything if that's more of your style!

You can also run `npx create-t3-universal-app` to start your project! (by [albbus](https://github.com/albbus-stack/create-t3-universal-app))

**This repo is made on top of**:

- [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo): expo, next, trpc, prisma, nextauth - no UI code share & no mobile auth.
- [t3-turbo-and-clerk](https://github.com/clerkinc/t3-turbo-and-clerk): t3 turbo with auth for mobile + web - still no UI code share.
- [tamagui + solito starter](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/starters/next-expo-solito): expo + next code share - no tRPC & no built-in auth.
