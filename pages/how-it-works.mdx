### In a bit more detail

Your **frontend** code will be in React Native, meaning that you're going to write Views instead of divs. Since we are using Tamagui in particular, we're gonna write Stacks instead Views.

- `apps/expo` and `apps/next` are practically empty folders that are simply _referencing_ your `packages/app` folder.
- If you're familiar with React Native, it's going to feel as if you're writing a React Native app, that just happens to also run really well on the web (with SSR and all of those goodies).
- Your code will get rendered as HTML/CSS on the NextJS side and normal React Native on the native side.

Your **backend** code is gonna be in `packages/api`. NextJS is going to run this code in a serverless environment, if you're a little confused about how that works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB5Fh46Vi4&t=1017s)'s a good video by Theo that talks about NextJS as a backend framework.

- Your backend and frontend will communicate with tRPC.
- Your backend and your DB will communicate with Prisma (ORM).
- Mobile auth is done with Clerk Expo, and web auth is done with Clerk React and Clerk Next.
